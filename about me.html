	<h1>A Few Things About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Anastasia Johnson. I am a student at Pathways in Technolegy Early College High school(P-Tech) and I have a passion for coding. 
    
    I attend a coding fellowship at Etsy through a program called Code Nation where I learn how to use different coding platforms such as repl.it popcode, and gitpod. I also learn how to use programming languages such as javascript, html, css and
	javascript to build more advanced websites. I like learning new coding languages to build websites, games,and more. I want to go further and explore more what a field in technolegy may hold for me. I want to pursue a career in software engineering and actively participating in a Etsy fellowship through Code Nation is taking early steps towards that goal.</p>
